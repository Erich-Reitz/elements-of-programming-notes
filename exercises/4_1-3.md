## Exercise 4.1 - 4.3

### Strict Relation

Never holds between an element and itself

### Reflexive Relation

Always holds between an element and itself

## Symmetric Relation

Whenever it holds in one direction, it holds in the other.

#### Exercise 4.1

Relation that is neither strict nor reflexive?

Sum < 5.
- Is predicate -> bool
- Is homogeneous Function
- Arity = 2

r(1, 1) holds, so not strict.
r(3, 3) doesn't, so not reflexive.

#### Exercise 4.2

Symmetric relation that is not transitive?

Individuals are similar in age.

- abs(age, age) < 5.
- 30, 34, 38 
    - (30, 34) good, (34, 38) good but not (30, 38).

#### Exercise 4.3

Symmetric relation that is not reflexive?

Individuals are different in age.

- a1 != a2.
- never holds between an element and itself
- a1 != a2 implies a2 != a1
