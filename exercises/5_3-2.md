#### Lemma 5.2

$f(n) = n^3$ serves as the multiplicative inverse for the multiplication of non-zero remainders modulo 5.

#### Proof

Using Euler's Theorem:

> If $n$ and $a$ are relatively prime, then $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n$.

$e = 1$,  $\phi(5) = 4$. 

Thus, for any integer $a$ that is relatively prime to 5, we have $a^4 \equiv 1 \mod 5$.

Or, $a^3 a \equiv 1 \mod 5$
